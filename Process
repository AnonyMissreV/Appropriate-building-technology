Many things, are free already. Let's get some of these links from the internet and various sources that we think are replicable here.

What is free? 
Free materials that everyone has already: needle nose pliers, hammer. Take the means of production, take the land.
[EM-Che] Let's have folks take tools, you get a saw of choice and a drill, and otherwise whatever materials, manifest.
Materials always free. Can this be a requirement?? Does this logically contain sustainability?
What is GAIA process?
Can things BE free, as in don't buy anything, and can that be DONE for free?
[EM-Che] Someone said, "everything is impossible until it isn't." 

Justice and inclusiveness.
final requirement: When change comes, we can't leave anyone behind....
