Earthbags
Seems a good reference: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865715076?ie=UTF8&tag=offgrissurvival-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0865715076
The earthbag sustainable method revolves around bags of stone, or possibly old tires packed with earth. The first method is
expensive but accomplishs all goals, the second is sustainable but has little insulation and plenty of thermal bridges.
Possibly shreaded tires could work as a low cost insulation breaking the thermal bridge. -SSC.

Passive solar
YouTube user Energyquarter has some great videos on Passive House standards. BUT I intend yo build them completely differently.
 Using earthbag building technology, likely strawbales for insulation on the outside.
